## Create and share your important events ##

### Functionalities ###
With Schedama you can create an event, save it and share it with others so they can indicate their participation.

After *event creation*, 2 distinct links are generated:
1. *Participant link*    -> Anyone with this link can see the event and register availability and participation
2. *Administration link* -> Anyone with this link can fully administrate the event. That includes modify dates and location, add/remove participants and even delete the event.

### Event administration ###
Newly created events will contain an "admin_key" field.
This key will be generated during event creation and it needs to be added as a parameter to the url in order to be able to open the event in edit mode.
